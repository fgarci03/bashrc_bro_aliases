# bashrc_bro_aliases
These are my actual aliases. Some are funny, some are handy, and they are in profile.d, in order to be available for all users. Feel free to add some more!

## Usage
Yeah, as if you don't know how to! Still, if you don't wanna put them there by hand, just clone the repo and ```sudo ./source_aliases.sh```. It will place them in the correct place. It will work for you current session immediatly, and after a reboot, for all users.

### Have fun!
